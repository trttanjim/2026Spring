    "# Review: Defining Classes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Python is an object-oriented programming language because everything in Python is treated as an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the idea of structuring your program around objects. An object is a self-contained entity that can interact with other objects. Programs can consist of multiple objects, each capable of utilizing the properties and functions of other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An object in Python consists of two key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes**: These are the data or properties stored within the object.\n",
    "- **Methods**: These are functions defined within an object that can operate on its attributes and accept additional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have encountered various built-in Python objects, such as strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Each of these objects comes with associated attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider an integer object named `i`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have said before, to view the attributes and methods associated with this integer object, type a period (`.`) after its name and press the Tab key. A dropdown menu will appear, displaying the available attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can use the `dir()` function to list all attributes and methods linked to an object. The entries that begin with underscores (`__`) are internal and used by Python itself, while the rest can be used for operations.  We'll talk more about these sorts of functions later.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dir(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a method associated with `i` is `as_integer_ratio()`, which returns a tuple representing the fraction equivalent of the integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i.as_integer_ratio()\n",
    "# returns: (5, 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes do not require parentheses because they store data, whereas methods must include parentheses as they are functions that can take arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"

    "## Defining a Basic Class\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is a template for objects. It defines the attributes and methods associated with instances of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Analogy: The Cat Class**\n",
    "For example, a class **`Cat`** can have:\n",
    "- **Attributes**: Characteristics shared by all cats, such as `breed`, `fur_color`, etc.\n",
    "- **Methods**: Actions that cats can perform, such as `run()`, `meow()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more, refer to the official [Python documentation on classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instance**\n",
    "An **instance** is a specific realization of an object of a particular class. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "If **`Cat`** is a class, then an actual cat named *Fluffy* would be an **instance** of the `Cat` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in the example below, the object `i` is an instance of the class `int`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 5          # An instance of the int class\n",
    "print(type(i))  # returns: <class 'int'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a class in Python, we use the `class` keyword. Below is a simple `Dachshund` class with an initializer method (`__init__`) to set up attributes.\n",

    "#### The Constructor (`__init__()` Method)  \n",
    "Most classes include a special method called `__init__`, known as the constructor. This method is automatically invoked when an object (or instance) of the class is created. Its primary function is to initialize the class’s attributes.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The `self` Argument  \n",
    "This is the first parameter of every method in a class. It represents the instance of the class, allowing access to its attributes and methods. Using `self` ensures that the class’s attributes and methods are distinguishable from other variables and functions in the program.  \n",
