    "Object-oriented programming takes center stage in COMP142, the second-level programming course at Rhodes. DATA242 builds on this foundation by integrating concepts from COMP142 (Object-Oriented Programming) and COMP241 (Data Structures and Algorithms). In this course, we’ll explore how algorithms and objects can be leveraged to work effectively with data. Let’s take a moment to review what we already know about objects—you encountered them in COMP141, even if you didn’t realize it at the time!\n",

    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. Simply put, this means that everything in Python—numbers, strings, data structures, functions, classes, modules, etc.—is represented as an object within the Python interpreter. Objects can have associated attributes and methods.   That is, object store data and there are specific opterations that we can do on the data.  For example, consider the following variable that stores an integer:\n"
